We are all currently studying for the CFGDegree in the Spring 2024 cohort.
This is our final project before completing our course, in the Data Science speciality.

### Project Description
This project is designed to provide an analysis of publically available data in order to answer the following two questions:

1. How effective does historic data suggest that government mitigations have been on affecting smoking prevalence?
2. Based on this analysis and the knowledge that legislation will continue to restrict access to tobacco what is the prediction for future smoking rates?

### Formats used
The main file used to provide data cleaning, detailed analysis and data visualisations is the "Main Jupyter Workbook file".  It is a Jupyter notebook and can be viewed directly in GitHub by clicking on the file.  It can also be downloaded to be viewed offline.
The other files are in csv and Microsoft Excel formats.

### How to use the files
The main file is "Main Jupyter Workbook", which contains details of the data cleaning and analysis we have performed.
The requirements needed to run it are detailed in the "requirements.txt" file.

A downloaded copy of the APIs, which request data directly from the World Health Organisation in the main file can be found in the "WHO API Download" folder. All other cleaned data files are in the 'Cleaned_Data' folder. 

The orginal datasets are contained within their own folders, named by the data source they are drawn from. The raw and cleaned CSVs are referenced in the notebook by their raw URL so will import without needing to be downloaded locally.
