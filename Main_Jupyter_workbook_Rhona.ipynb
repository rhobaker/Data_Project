Each year the age at which people can legally buy cigarettes will increase, resulting in people born after 31st December 2008 never being able to buy them.  The government believed that this would reduce the harm caused by smoking, which is still the number one cause of preventable deaths in the UK and costs the NHS £17bn a year.\n",

A steady rise in use as expected as smoking rates decrease and e-cigarettes are used as quitting tools or less harmful alternatives to smoking. However the very sharp increase of e-cigarette use in younger people is far above the expected rate, considerably higher than the recent smoking rate in this demographic. Government mitigations on vaping should therefore be focussed on young people; without mitigations the rate of vaping in young people could rise exponentially.\n",
        "\n",
        "The planned ban on disposable vapes is likely to reduce the e-cigarette usage rate in young people, with an overwhelming majority of those 11-17 using disposable vapes most frequently, although this will also benefit other age groups. The UK government have stated that alongside banning disposable vapes, measures will be brought forward to to restrict vape flavours, displays and packaging, to make them less attractive to children. Our MPOWER analysis shows that government mitigations effectively reduced smoking rates by including measures on displays and advertising, therefore this ban is likely to be effective and curb the rise in the vaping rate in young people by introducing restrictions in these areas, particularly as vaping flavours and colours are more attractive to younger people."

Our model roughly predicts that without any further mitigations, the smoking rate would be at 8% by 2030. With the proposed smoking ban to be enacted in 2027, it is a realistic estimation, based on looking at effects of past mitigations on the rate of decrease in the smoking rate, that the ban would cause at least an extra 1% decrease in the rate per year from 2020, allowing the goverment to reach its 'smokefree' goal by 2030."

        "Our analysis set out to answer the questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**How effective does historic data suggest that government mitigations have been on affecting smoking prevalence?**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Based on this analysis, how effective will the new ban be on reducing smoking prevalence?**\n",

        "Firstly, we determined that global smoking rates reduced from 28.1% in 2007 to 20.9% in 2022 and that this strongly correlated to government intervention measures increasing over the same period.\n",
        "\n",
        "When then focused our analysis on the UK to see if it followed this global trend. We saw a similar movement in smoking rates, reducing from 27.0% in 2000 to 15.6% in 2019.  This can be seen to link with government intervention measures around packaging and advertising becoming more stringent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our analysis of the tax paid on a packet of cigarettes shows that...\n",
        "\n",
        "As tax has significantly increased the price of cigarettes, we can see that the affordability of tobacco has decreased.  This strongly correlates with the decrease in smoking rates and from this we can infer that decreasing the affordability of tobacco by increasing taxes is linked to a reduction in the overall smoking rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then looked at the impact of e-cigarettes on changes in the overall tobacco smoking rate as anecdotal evidence and our own personal experiences suggest that there has been a significant increase in e-cigarette use in the past few years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our analysis shows that as e-cigarette use has increased, the smoking rate has decreased, however the spike in e-cigarette use is disproportionally due to the younger generation, therefore how much impact this is having on overall smoking rates is harder to determine.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally we examined the available data to see if other socio-economic factors could be influencing the drop in smoking rate, outside of direct government control.\n",
        "\n",
        "We could see that there was a clear link between education level and smoking rates; the higher the education level someone has the less likely they are to smoke.  *As education levels have been increasing over recent years this is likely to have had an influence on smoking rates decreasing.*\n",
        "\n",
        "When we did a similar analysis for differences between smoking rates in men and women we could not see any similar trends, so we concluded that any future government interventions should equally consider both men and women when their implmentation is planned.\n",
        "\n",
        "The evidence therefore suggests that smoking rates will continue to fall if the future government, elected in the July 2024 UK general election, continues to tighten legislation and increase tax in a similar way to previous ones.  Socio-economic trends influencing e-cigarette use and education levels may also impact this reduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our simple machine learning model shows that without further mitigations, the smoking rate is predicted to continue to fall but is at risk of not reaching the government smokefree target by 2030. If the ban is implemented, the target could realistically be reached."
